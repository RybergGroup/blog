<h1>A little bit about classifications</h1>
<p>
We humans have a natural need to classify things to create a structure to think about them.
We have for example, family and non family members, and classify relatives based partly on gender and how closely related they are: brother, sister, grandmother, cousin, second cousin, etc.
Alternatively we can classify people based on profession: carpenter, biologist and so on.
Which classification is best suited will vary by situation.
</p>

<p>
In biology we have many different classifications.
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_y/858039040/in/album-72157600921320279/" title="IMG_2181"><img class="right" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1238/858039040_aa4b24880c_c.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="IMG_2181"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
We may classify animals by what they eat, e.g. carnivore, omnivore, or herbivore.
Such classifications are important for how we think about them, if I for example say that X is a carnivore you think differently about it than if I say it is a herbivore.
However it is usually difficult to make clear cut classes that are still meaningful.
Most vegetation contains some animals like nematodes that get eaten together with the plant, and I am sure cows swallows flies once in a while and even tigers eat plants sometimes.
The scale is therefore more continuous and in many cases any cut-off is arbitrary to some extent, and usually not even explicit.
This does not mean that the classification is pointless, it may still be very useful in describing and thinking about biology, but there is a limit to its utility.
</p>

<p>
It is also important to note that an organism belong to a class due to its traits, and do not have it traits because it belongs to the class, in other words: a tiger is a carnivore because it mainly eats meat, it does not eat meat because it is a carnivore.
In other words, we make the classification, the organisms are doing what they are doing.
So when we describe, think, and reason about organisms we should make sure that our classification is meaningful for our reasoning, otherwise the reasoning will be flawed. If your axis is continuous you also need to ask how many classes you need to make it just, or even if it is meaningful to make it discrete, maybe it is more interesting to think where along the axis the different organisms belong.
It all depends on the context.</p>

<p>
Some classifications may capture an organism better than another, while the other classification capture the most important characters of another organism.

You may therefore sometimes see classifications that are hybrids between different systems.
Mycorrhizal fungi form a root associated mutualistic biotrofic symbiosis with plants.
It is thus a fairly specific class but it describe many species of fungi well.
Being mycorrhizal is often contrasted against being saprotrophic or free-living but this does not say much about the organisms in these classes.
The two classes are not a complete classification either, since fungi can be biotrophs and/or not free living but not mycorrhizal.
In a limited context, it may be possible to classify all organisms of interest into one of the categories, but in others it will not.
So when ever classifying organisms you should make sure that the classification is sufficient for your purposes so that everything can be put in a relevant class.
</p>

<p>There are many classifications in biology, because each serve a different purpose.
It is important to realize that each classification has its own utility, but it is the situation that determine what classification is useful.
It should also be realized that taxa, the groups in taxonomy, are different from classes but more on that in another post.
